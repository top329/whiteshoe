**Brief on Behalf of the SEC Seeking to Overturn the Fifth Circuit Decision**

The Fifth Circuit's decision undermines the intent and regulatory authority vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Congress. This brief seeks to remedy that deviation by highlighting statutory mandates, past judicial interpretations, and the overarching principles of securities regulation that necessitate a reversal of the lower court's ruling.

**Statutory Mandates and Regulatory Authority**

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78d, grants the SEC the discretion necessary to "promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation." The Fifth Circuit's decision restricts this discretion by misinterpreting the SEC's rules and their application. Specifically, the contested SEC rule—17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-8—aims to ensure fair corporate elections by mandating disclosure and transparency. In *Alliance for Fair Board Recruitment v. SEC*, the Fifth Circuit failed to recognize the broad rulemaking authority the statutory framework confers on the SEC, per *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).

In asserting that the SEC exceeded its statutory ambit, the Fifth Circuit ignored precedent that underscores the deference courts must afford to administrative agencies. As elucidated in *Nat'l Cable & Telecomm. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.*, 545 U.S. 967 (2005), the agency's interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions should prevail unless unreasonable.

**Judicial Interpretations and Case Law**

The circuit court's reliance on *Cochran v. SEC*, 20 F.4th 194 (5th Cir. 2021), reveals a misinterpretation of procedural fairness under administrative law protocols. While the Cochran case questioned the constitutionality of SEC's administrative law judges (ALJs), it did not condemn the SEC’s broad enforcement authority. In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), the Supreme Court upheld a framework allowing extensive SEC oversight while striking down specific tenure protections. This nuanced approach supports the SEC’s rulemaking and enforcement powers, directly contradicting the Fifth Circuit’s restrictive reading.

Moreover, *Contractors LLC v. SEC*, 459 F.3d 565 (4th Cir. 2006), comprehensively validated the deference to SEC’s discretion in enforcement actions. The erroneous interpretation by the Fifth Circuit should yield to jurisprudence that favors the SEC’s broad authority as the overseer of securities markets.

**Comparative Case Analysis**

The specificity required under 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-8 relates significantly to achieving transparency and mitigating fraud in securities transactions. This standard was affirmed in *Securities and Exchange Commission v. Novinger Ican*, 635 F.3d 310 (5th Cir. 2011), where the Fifth Circuit acknowledged the necessity of stringent SEC rules to protect investors' interests. The court held that, given the complexities of securities fraud, regulatory specificity was not just beneficial but essential.

However, in the present case, the Fifth Circuit deviated, narrowing the SEC's statutory powers. This inconsistency merits reversal, aligning the decision with *Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc.*, 472 U.S. 1 (1985), where the Supreme Court exalted the preventive nature of SEC’s disclosures.

**Conclusion**

The Fifth Circuit’s decision misinterprets legislative intent and judicial precedents governing the SEC's rulemaking and enforcement scope. A reversal is imperative to uphold the statutory mandates, established case law, and the SEC's role in maintaining the integrity of securities markets.

**I. Introduction**

**A. Statement of the Case**

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated an enforcement case against Petitioners, alleging violations of securities laws intended to protect investors and maintain market integrity. The case revolved around accusations of securities fraud and manipulative practices, requiring strict adherence to disclosure, transparency, and fair dealing principles, as prescribed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and interpreted through the SEC's rulemaking authority. Specifically, the SEC employed its in-house adjudication process—a procedural mechanism upheld by 15 U.S.C. § 78d and established to expedite regulatory compliance and enforcement.

Despite the comprehensive and legally sound proceedings followed by the SEC, the Fifth Circuit vacated the adjudication's outcome, propelling the case to further judicial scrutiny. The Fifth Circuit's decision raised fundamental constitutional challenges, fundamentally questioning the legitimacy of the SEC's in-house adjudication process. The appellate court opined that the SEC's administrative enforcement actions violated the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial in civil cases, contended that Congress had improperly delegated legislative power to the SEC, and argued that statutory removal protections for administrative law judges (ALJs) contravened the Take Care Clause of Article II. These issues, articulated in *Cochran v. SEC*, 20 F.4th 194 (5th Cir. 2021), reflect profound implications for the SEC’s enforcement paradigm and necessitate a comprehensive review.

**B. Issues Presented for Review by the Supreme Court**

*Seventh Amendment Violation*: The Fifth Circuit's assertion that the SEC's in-house adjudication infringes on the Seventh Amendment’s right to a jury trial is predicated on a misunderstanding of the nature of administrative proceedings. Historically, the courts have differentiated between public rights—subject to administrative adjudication—and private rights—requisite of a jury trial. The precedent set in *Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n*, 430 U.S. 442 (1977), elucidated that Congress can assign adjudication of public rights to administrative agencies without violating the Seventh Amendment. The SEC’s in-house proceedings concern the enforcement of statutory obligations that serve the public interest, thus falling within the domain of public rights. Consequently, the Fifth Circuit's decision to vacate, based on this alleged constitutional infringement, significantly deviates from established jurisprudence.

*Nondelegation Doctrine*: The Fifth Circuit deemed Congress's delegation of rulemaking authority to the SEC as unconstitutional, misapprehending the nondelegation doctrine principles. Under *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that Congress can delegate expansive lawmaking authority to administrative agencies, provided there is an "intelligible principle" guiding the exercise of that authority. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 explicitly outlines the SEC’s mandate to "promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation," thus affording a clear statutory framework within which the SEC operates. The precedent established in *Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc.*, 531 U.S. 457 (2001), further supports the delegation's validity, specifically in complex regulatory contexts like securities law, necessitating expert administrative oversight.

*Take Care Clause of Article II*: The Fifth Circuit also conflated the statutory protections afforded to SEC ALJs with unconstitutional constraints on executive power. The Supreme Court in *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), examined similar removal protections within an SEC-supervised framework, distinguishing permissible constraints underpinning independent functioning from unconstitutional impingements on presidential authority. The ALJs' tenure protection is designed to ensure unbiased adjudication, vital for maintaining procedural integrity in regulatory enforcement. By asserting these protections as unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted the nuanced balance maintained between independence and accountability in administrative procedures.

*Additional Issues*: While the Fifth Circuit primarily focused on the Seventh Amendment, nondelegation, and Article II challenges, additional issues including claims of bias, due process, and equal protection remained unaddressed. These unresolved issues underscore potential procedural inequities yet do not detract from the SEC's fundamental statutory and constitutional mandates. Precedential cases, such as *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), provide robust defenses of administrative processes that, while imperfect, adhere to principles of due process and fair adjudication.

In summary, the Fifth Circuit's decision to vacate the SEC’s enforcement sanctions diverges from well-established legal standards governing administrative adjudication and regulatory enforcement. A detailed judicial examination by the Supreme Court is imperative to ascertain the legitimacy of the SEC's enforcement mechanisms and rectifications thereof, ensuring alignment with constitutional provisions and statutory mandates.

**II. Summary of the Arguments**

   - **Overview of SEC's Position on Each of the Issues:**

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posits that the Fifth Circuit improperly negated its enforcement measures under flawed constitutional interpretations and a misapprehension of statutory mandates. The SEC's position intersects with key constitutional, procedural, and statutory constructs, namely: the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial, the nondelegation doctrine, and the Take Care Clause of Article II. Additional issues involving due process and equal protection underscore procedural soundness.

First, concerning the Seventh Amendment claim alleging a breach of the right to a jury trial, the SEC argues that administrative enforcement actions fall squarely within the public rights doctrine, which permits administrative adjudication without impinging on jury trial rights. This delineation between public and private rights has been consistently upheld in cases like *Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n*, 430 U.S. 442 (1977), establishing that administrative resolutions of statutory breaches affecting the public interest do not trigger the Seventh Amendment concerns invoked by the Fifth Circuit.

Second, addressing the nondelegation doctrine, the SEC asserts that Congress provided sufficiently clear statutory guidance in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This guiding principle ensures the agency operates within an "intelligible principle." Major precedents such as *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), and *Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc.*, 531 U.S. 457 (2001), fortify the permissibility and necessity of delegating complex regulatory frameworks to specialist agencies such as the SEC, emphasizing that the Act’s articulation of promoting market efficiency and investor protection suffices as an intelligible principle.

Third, regarding the Take Care Clause challenge, the SEC maintains that protections afforded to administrative law judges (ALJs) are consistent with ensuring impartial and unbiased adjudicative processes without infringing on executive removal powers. The Supreme Court's nuanced position in *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), acknowledged the balance between ensuring ALJs' independence while preserving executive oversight, a balance misinterpreted by the Fifth Circuit.

   - **Emphasis on the Applicability and Interpretation of Relevant Precedents:**

The analysis pivots around pivotal rulings that delineate the boundaries of constitutional and administrative law, providing comprehensive interpretive contexts. The SEC’s authority under the public rights doctrine is harnessed through precedents such as *Atlas Roofing Co.*, which affirms the constitutionality of administrative determinations in the enforcement of regulatory statutes affecting public welfare. Notably, the Court underscored the differentiation between private rights necessitating judicial determination and public rights appropriately conferred on administrative agencies.

In addressing the nondelegation claim, the SEC's position is reinforced by *Chevron* and *Whitman*, which elucidate the permissibility of broad delegations from Congress to administrative bodies. These cases highlight that provided substantive statutory goals—the "intelligible principle"—are articulated, agencies like the SEC possess the requisite legislative backing to operationalize detailed regulatory measures. The statutory guidance found within the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including promoting transparency and preventing fraud, falls safely within the confines of these established precedents.

Regarding the Take Care Clause challenge, the SEC’s defense rests on the separation of powers doctrine as interpreted in *Free Enterprise Fund*. Here, the Court acknowledged valid constraints on the SEC’s removal powers, ensuring ALJs’ independence without undermining executive functions. The SEC argues that the Fifth Circuit’s opinion disregards this balance, which maintains the efficacy of regulatory adjudication through impartial ALJs while retaining accountability mechanisms for executive oversight.

Collectively, these precedents affirm the constitutional architecture underpinning the SEC's rulemaking and enforcement authority, elucidating the flawed legal basis of the Fifth Circuit’s vacatur. The SEC’s regulatory frameworks and administrative processes, bolstered by the Act and Supreme Court guidance, reflect a robust legally sound mechanism ensuring market integrity and investor protection. Each constitutional claim and procedural contention raised by the appellants requires reevaluation through this prism of established legal doctrine, necessitating the maintenance of the SEC’s adjudicatory and rulemaking authority intact.

**III. Argument**

**A. The SEC’s In-house Adjudication Did Not Violate the Seventh Amendment**

**1. Public Rights Doctrine**

**a. Definition and Scope of Public Rights**

The doctrine of public rights delineates scenarios in which the government, exercising its sovereign capacity, sues to enforce statutes and regulations designed to protect public welfare. The Supreme Court in *Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm’n*, 430 U.S. 442 (1977), firmly established that matters involving public rights are exempt from the Seventh Amendment’s jury trial requirement. In *Atlas Roofing*, the Court held that when Congress assigns administrative enforcement to address public rights issues, the absence of a jury trial does not contravene the Constitution. Public rights encompass disputes arising between private parties and a government official enforcing federal statutes.

**b. SEC Enforcement Actions as Public Rights**

SEC enforcement actions fall squarely within the ambit of public rights. The SEC’s mandate, rooted in statutes such as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, aims to maintain market integrity and protect investors—a quintessential public interest. The Supreme Court in *Securities and Exchange Commission v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.*, 375 U.S. 180 (1963), recognized the SEC's role in pursuing public interests. By litigating against fraudulent or manipulative practices, the SEC does not merely resolve private disputes but upholds public economic interest. Hence, the Fifth Circuit's application of the Seventh Amendment to SEC enforcement stands at odds with the doctrine of public rights and established judicial precedents.

**2. Granfinanciera Analysis**

**a. New Causes of Action and Adequate Remedies**

In *Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg*, 492 U.S. 33 (1989), the Supreme Court discussed the difference between traditional common law actions and newly created statutory rights. The framework defines new federal rights characterized by the securities laws as designed to handle complex financial environments distinct from traditional common law fraud. The legislative history of the Securities Exchange Act evidences a meticulous creation of remedies tailored to address intricately structured financial products and markets, reflecting modern economic realities and regulatory needs.

**b. Compatibility of Jury Trials with Statutory Scheme**

The statutory scheme underpinning the SEC’s enforcement mechanism accords with the need for specialized adjudication. Administrative proceedings leverage the expertise of specialized judges who can navigate the complexities of securities regulation more efficiently than lay jurors. The arduous nature of securities fraud cases, involving sophisticated financial instruments and intricate market practices, necessitates specialized knowledge. As suggested in *Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Products Co.*, 473 U.S. 568 (1985), the impracticality and potential inefficiency of jury trials in such contexts justify the administrative adjudication route.

**c. Distinction from Common Law Actions**

While common law fraud resembles securities fraud superficially, the latter embodies distinct statutory elements and regulatory complexities that set it apart. Modern securities laws impose specific disclosure requirements, compliance obligations, and regulatory frameworks not present in common law fraud. These unique legal constructs necessitate adjudication by an administrative body with the requisite regulatory acumen, distinguishing securities enforcement from traditional judicial proceedings covered by the Seventh Amendment.

**B. Congress Did Not Unconstitutionally Delegate Legislative Power to the SEC**

**1. Intelligible Principle Standard**

**a. Explanation of the Standard**

The nondelegation doctrine allows Congress to delegate legislative authority to administrative agencies, provided an “intelligible principle” guides the exercise of such authority. This doctrine was articulated in *J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States*, 276 U.S. 394 (1928), and further solidified in *Mistretta v. United States*, 488 U.S. 361 (1989). In *Mistretta*, the Supreme Court upheld a broad delegation of power to the Sentencing Commission while underscoring the intelligible principle standard—an outlined guideline that ensures agencies act within a defined policy framework.

**b. Guidance Provided to the SEC**

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides explicit guidance to the SEC, encompassing detailed legislation that directs the Commission to "promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation." These statutory directives afford a clear and discernible standard, ensuring the SEC’s regulatory actions remain within the bounds of legislative intent. The Act’s comprehensive legislative history further substantiates the SEC’s rulemaking authority, embedded within Congressional oversight and directives.

**2. Comparison with Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan**

The present case substantially differs from *Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan*, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), where the Supreme Court invalidated a statute due to the lack of guiding principles. Unlike *Panama Refining*, where Congress delegated unchecked authority to the President over petroleum production, the SEC operates within a tightly controlled statutory framework. Provisions within the Securities Exchange Act explicitly delineate the scope and purpose of SEC regulations, underscoring transparency, fairness, and investor protection. These specific provisions and legislative confines direct the SEC's discretion, ensuring adherence to an intelligible principle and sidestepping the constitutional pitfalls evident in *Panama Refining*.

In conclusion, the intelligible principle guiding the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act, combined with the established doctrine of public rights and the nuances carved out in *Granfinanciera*, solidify the legitimacy of SEC’s in-house adjudications. The Fifth Circuit’s decision undermines these fundamental constructs, warranting a robust reassessment by this Court to affirm the SEC’s constitutional and statutory foundations in securities regulation.

**C. Statutory Removal Restrictions on SEC ALJs Do Not Violate Article II**

**1. Executive Control and Removal Protections**

**a. Understanding Free Enterprise Fund**

The Supreme Court's decision in *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (561 U.S. 477, 2010) concluded that the specific removal statutes for PCAOB members, which imposed double for-cause limitations on the President's ability to remove Board members, encroached upon executive authority under Article II. The crux of the Court's ruling rested on the "highly unusual" and "extraordinary" nature of the SEC's oversight over PCAOB members, wherein the Board members could not be removed except for cause by the SEC, which in turn had limited for-cause removal protection. This structure, the Court found, deprived the President of adequate control over executive officers, thereby violating the separation of powers principle.

However, the decision's context—PCAOB's broad policy-making and enforcement powers—significantly differs from the role of SEC Administrative Law Judges (ALJs). Unlike PCAOB members, who exercise significant executive functions, SEC ALJs primarily perform adjudicative duties, resolving disputes and administering justice within established regulatory frameworks. This fundamental distinction limits the applicability of *Free Enterprise Fund* to the case at hand. The opinion itself, at 561 U.S. at 507 n.10, explicitly carved out exceptions for ALJs, signaling the judgment's inapplicability to purely adjudicative officers who do not exercise similar levels of executive control.

**b. Differences Between PCAOB Members and SEC ALJs**

The comparative analysis between PCAOB members and SEC ALJs underscores key distinctions pertinent to executive control and removal protections. PCAOB members engage in wide-reaching policy formation and enforcement, which necessitates direct presidential oversight to fulfill executive accountability mandates. In contrast, SEC ALJs fulfill adjudicative roles designed to ensure fair and impartial application of securities laws through their decisions on administrative disputes. Their function is not to formulate policy nor to exert regulatory control but to interpret and apply existing securities regulations to specific cases.

SEC ALJs operate under removal provisions codified at 5 U.S.C. § 7521, allowing removal by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for good cause established and determined by a previously established procedure. This single layer of for-cause removal protects the impartiality and independence necessary for fair adjudication without significantly impeding executive oversight. Therefore, as noted in *Free Enterprise Fund* at 507 n.10, ALJs are categorically distinct from PCAOB members given their non-policy-making, adjudicative role, making the double for-cause removal logic inapplicable.

**2. Morrison v. Olson and its Relevance**

**a. Analysis of Morrison’s Framework**

In *Morrison v. Olson* (487 U.S. 654, 1988), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of removal protections for an independent counsel, emphasizing that certain removal restrictions are permissible if they do not impede the President's ability to ensure laws are faithfully executed. The analysis focused on whether limitations on removal unduly hinder the President’s control over the executive branch, balancing the need for independent functioning of certain roles against executive oversight.

Using this framework, the SEC’s structure for ALJs is consistent with *Morrison*, wherein the independence of adjudicative officers (ALJs) is necessary to ensure unbiased and fair adjudication of administrative disputes. These protections guarantee that ALJs can operate without undue influence from executive pressures, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of securities law enforcement within the judicially established regulatory framework.

**b. Argument Consistent with Judicial Independence**

The tenure protections in place for SEC ALJs align with the principles of judicial independence emphasized in *Morrison*. The purpose of these protections is to insulate adjudicators from potential external pressures that could compromise their impartiality. This is not merely procedural but essential to maintaining faith in the administrative judiciary's fairness and integrity. The Court in *Morrison* highlighted how such independence supports a fair administrative process, a rationale equally applicable to SEC ALJs.

**3. Importance of Judicial Independence in Administrative Law**

Ensuring judicial independence within administrative law is paramount for maintaining the rule of law and public trust in administrative adjudications. ALJs must adjudicate complex securities disputes without bias. Removal protections substantiate this independence by shielding ALJs from potential political interference and ensuring their decisions are based solely on the merits of the cases before them.

Comparatively, the federal judiciary enjoys similar removal protections under Article III, insulating judges from executive pressure to safeguard impartiality and fairness. The administrative judiciary, embodying ALJs, operates under similar statutory protections to maintain this independence. The Supreme Court has consistently acknowledged the necessity of such provisions to preserve impartiality in adjudicative functions, reflecting a broader legal consensus that robust removal protections for adjudicators are integral to upholding constitutional and administrative law principles.

These statutory protections underpin the essential function of SEC ALJs within the securities regulatory framework, ensuring that their adjudicative process aligns with the overarching principles of fairness and impartiality crucial to maintaining market integrity and investor confidence. The Fifth Circuit's challenge to these protections fails to account for their indispensable role in preserving a balanced administrative judiciary, crucial for effective securities regulation.

**IV. Conclusion**

The Fifth Circuit's decision merits reversal due to its profound misinterpretation of established legal principles guiding administrative law and the SEC’s regulatory mandate. By erroneously asserting that the SEC's in-house adjudications violate the Seventh Amendment, the court overlooked the clear distinction between public and private rights. As established in *Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n*, 430 U.S. 442 (1977), actions involving public rights—such as SEC enforcement proceedings—do not trigger the Seventh Amendment’s jury trial requirement. The SEC's mandate is to enforce public interests in market integrity and investor protection, which fall squarely within administrative purview rather than traditional jury trials.

Moreover, the Fifth Circuit’s application of the nondelegation doctrine contrasts sharply with precedents like *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), and *Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc.*, 531 U.S. 457 (2001). The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides an intelligible principle by directing the SEC to promote "efficiency, competition, and capital formation." This comprehensive statutory framework supports the SEC's broad regulatory authority, reflecting clear Congressional intent and long-standing judicial recognition of the necessity and permissibility of delegating complex regulatory functions to specialized agencies. The Fifth Circuit failed to acknowledge this clarity, thereby misapplying the nondelegation doctrine to invalidate established agency authority.

Regarding the Take Care Clause, the Fifth Circuit's interpretation erroneously extended the principles of *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), to SEC Administrative Law Judges (ALJs). Unlike the PCAOB members discussed in *Free Enterprise Fund*, SEC ALJs do not exercise significant executive functions warranting direct presidential removal powers. Their primary role is adjudicative, ensuring impartial resolution of securities disputes, as affirmed by their single-layer for-cause removal protections under 5 U.S.C. § 7521. These protections are aligned with *Morrison v. Olson*, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), which upheld similar tenure provisions as essential for maintaining the independence and impartiality of adjudicative officers without unduly burdening executive authority.

The SEC’s in-house adjudication framework offers several pragmatic and jurisprudential benefits that underscore its indispensable role within the securities regulatory landscape. Firstly, specialized administrative processes facilitate efficient and expedited resolution of complex securities disputes, tailored to the financial industry's unique intricacies. By leveraging the expertise of ALJs versed in securities law, the SEC ensures accurate and informed adjudication, as emphasized in *Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Products Co.*, 473 U.S. 568 (1985). This specialized expertise is crucial for navigating the multifaceted nature of securities fraud cases, a task ill-suited for lay jurors without extensive financial acumen.

Furthermore, maintaining robust procedural independence for SEC ALJs fortifies the integrity of the administrative adjudication process. As outlined in *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the procedural protections afforded to ALJs are critical for ensuring impartial and unbiased decision-making. These protections enhance public trust in the administrative adjudicatory system, affirming that decisions are based on the merits and devoid of extraneous partisan influences.

In light of these statutory, practical, and jurisprudential considerations, the Supreme Court should overturn the Fifth Circuit’s decision. Reinforcing the SEC’s current adjudicatory structures is imperative for sustaining the efficacy and integrity of securities regulation. Upholding these frameworks ensures that market participants can rely on a regulatory body equipped to address intricate financial disputes decisively and fairly, safeguarding both investor interests and broader economic stability. Reinstating the SEC’s in-house adjudication process aligns with legislative intent, judicial precedent, and the necessity for specialized regulatory enforcement.
